## Where to find the Timer
The timer feature is conveniently located on both the self-generate and AI generate pages. 
You can access it directly from these pages, where it is prominently displayed to assist you 
in managing your time effectively during your activities. Look for the timer button within 
these pages to begin using the feature.

## Setting the Timer
To set the timer, first locate the input field within the timer section. Enter the desired duration 
in minutes and seconds, depending on how long you want the timer to run. Once you’ve specified the 
duration, click the "Start" button to initiate the countdown. The timer will begin immediately and
display the remaining time prominently on the screen. If needed, you can adjust the duration 
before starting the timer, ensuring it fits your specific needs.

## Alerts and Notifications
When the timer reaches zero, an alert or notification will be triggered to signal the end of the set 
duration. This alert is designed to capture your attention, ensuring that you are aware of the timer's 
completion. The notification may come in the form of a sound, visual indicator, or both, depending on 
your settings. You can customize the alert sound and notification preferences through the settings 
menu to suit your preferences.

## Timer Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues with the timer, there are a couple of key aspects to check. First, ensure that 
the duration you’ve entered is valid and within acceptable limits. Incorrect input values can prevent the 
timer from functioning as expected. Additionally, verify that your browser or device supports the timer feature 
and that you have the latest updates installed. Compatibility issues can sometimes affect functionality. If you 
continue to experience problems or need further assistance, please consult the help section or reach out to our
