## Announcement Regarding Pricing

As of now, **Smart Study** is completely free for everyone. There are no payment plans, subscriptions, or membership fees. One of the primary reasons we created Smart Study was to offer a free resource to students. We understand the frustration of encountering paywalls on platforms like Quizlet, Chegg, and Studocu especially when you urgently need access to important study material.

Because of this, Smart Study remains free. However, there will be changes in the future. We plan to introduce a range of membership options. But for now, there's no need to worry. Our current focus is on building our user base, growing our community, and providing value to students.

## Future Membership Plans

While Smart Study is free now, we are planning to develop a membership system to offer premium features in the future. 

Our goal with these plans is to continue offering value to students at every level of commitment while ensuring our platform remains accessible. 

## Why We Will Introduce Pricing

We’re passionate about keeping education affordable, but to keep Smart Study sustainable, we will need to introduce paid plans down the line. Introducing memberships will allow us to:

- **Maintain and improve** the platform's quality.
- **Continuously update** content and add new features.
- **Support our development** team and infrastructure.
- **Provide a better** user experience with more personalized tools.

That said, we’re committed to always offering a free plan that includes core features so that anyone can use Smart Study without worrying about cost.

## When Will Pricing Start?

There is **no set date** for when our membership plans will begin. We’ll keep users informed with ample notice so everyone can make the best decision for their needs.
