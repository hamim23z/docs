## Self Generate Flashcard Creation
There are two exciting ways to create flashcards on our platform, and the most popular is the **self-generate** option. 
This is where you take control and craft your very own flashcards, perfectly tailored to your study goals.

## Automatic Redirection After Sign-In
After signing in, you'll automatically land on the Self Generate page, the main hub for your flashcard creation. 
No need to search around—just jump right in and start building your personalized deck. In this page, you will also
see multiple buttons such as "Create Card", "Save to Collection", "Timer", "Generate Using AI", and "Chat with Chronicle".

## Simple Yet Powerful Creation Tools
Creating flashcards couldn’t be easier. On this page, you can seamlessly input text for both the front and back 
of your cards. Whether you're entering quick notes, detailed definitions, or thought-provoking questions, 
our intuitive design ensures a smooth and hassle-free experience. Your flashcards will be ready in seconds.

## Study Smarter, Not Harder
Creating flashcards by yourself allows you to actually understand what's going on. That itself is a learning experience,
you're knowing what goes on the front and back, sort of like a definition. Create flashcards for anything. Flashcards are
used to study for almost every topic, big or small. If you never used flashcards before, hopefully Smart Study can change
your mind on that.
