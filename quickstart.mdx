## Dashboard

The dashboard is still currently in development. However, on every page, you see your user profile on the top right
and once you click on "Account Settings", you will be directed to a very basic and unfinished dashboard. There are 
very basic features there but the dashboard is a work in progress.

## How to Create flashcards

There are two ways to create flashcards on our site. The first method and probably the most used will be the self generate.
This will be the page where all users are automatically sent to after signing in. Here you can enter text to make your own
flashcards, the front and the back. Very simple and easy to use. The second method is generating flashcards using 
ChronicleAI. This is the AI Generate page and on this page, you enter text for Chronicle and he will create flashcards 
based on your request.
