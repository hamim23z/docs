## Dashboard

The dashboard is still currently in development. However, on every page, you see your user profile on the top right
and once you click on "Account Settings", you will be directed to a very basic and unfinished dashboard. There are 
very basic features there but the dashboard is a work in progress.

## How to Create Flashcards

There are two ways to create flashcards on our site. The first method and probably the most used will be the self generate.
This will be the page where all users are automatically sent to after signing in. Here you can enter text to make your own
flashcards, the front and the back. Very simple and easy to use. The second method is generating flashcards using 
ChronicleAI. This is the AI Generate page and on this page, you enter text for Chronicle and flashcards will be created
based on your request. 

## How to Use ChronicleAI

ChronicleAI is not just on Smart Study, there is an external site just for Chronicle. Firstly, let's talk about Chronicle on
Smart Study. On this page, you simply enter text into a text field. For example, "Generate Flashcards about Binary Search Trees".
After 10-20 seconds, your flashcards will be generated for you. It's that simple. 

Secondly, on the self generate page and the AI generate page, there is a button that says "Chat with Chronicle", this will take you
to the full version on Chronicle. This version serves as a chatbot where you can ask any questions regarding engineering. The link
can be found [here](https://chronicle-ai-omega.vercel.app/). 

## How to Use The Timer

The Timer feature is a useful tool to test yourself and your flashcards efficiently. Simply choose how long you want the timer to run, 
and it will appear on the screen, counting down the time you've set. As the timer runs, you can flip through your flashcards at your own 
pace. This helps you stay focused and keeps track of your study session, ensuring you maximize your time while practicing. When the timer 
ends, you'll receive an alert, signaling the completion of your session.
