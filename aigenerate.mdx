## AI Generating Flashcard Creation
This is the second method on how to create flashcards. Smart Study has an integrated AI, called Chad aka ChronicleAI. 
This is where you ask Chronicle about any topic and then it will make flashcards perfectly tailored to your study goals. 

## Meet Chronicle: Your AI Flashcard Assistant
On the **AI Generate** page, you’ll be introduced to Chronicle, the AI-powered assistant built into Smart Study. Simply enter 
your topic of interest into the text field, and let the AI do the rest. If you need more help rather than just flashcards, 
head on over to Chronicle's main site which serves as a chatbot. It can be found [here](https://chronicle-ai-omega.vercel.app/).

## Effortless Flashcard Generation
It’s as easy as typing a phrase like, “Generate flashcards about Binary Search Trees.” In just 10-20 seconds, your custom flashcards 
will appear, ready for you to study. No need to manually enter information—Chronicle generates high-quality flashcards in a snap.

## Study Smarter, Not Harder
The **AI Generate** feature allows you to focus on what really matters: learning. By using Chronicle, you save time while getting tailored 
flashcards that fit your needs. Whether it's a deep dive into algorithms or a quick review session, your study materials will be ready in no time.
